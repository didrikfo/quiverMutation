# Set firstDisplayedStep to k to skip displaying the quivers for the k first steps of the mutation graphically.
# Default is 0, which displays all steps. Set to len(mutationVertexList) to display only the final result.

# Quivers are given by the following:
# - Vertices are given as integers.
# - An arrows is given by a tuple containing 3 integers: (startVertex, endVertex, key).
#     - key is used to distinguish multiple arrows between the same pair of vertices. It is 0 if there is only one such
#       arrow, and it can usually be ignored.
# - A path is a list which contains all the vertices that path touches, in order.
# - A relation is given as a list of paths with the same start and end point, so a list of lists.
#   This is interpreted as the sum of these paths equalling zero. Coefficients are not supported.
